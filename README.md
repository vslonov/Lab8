Palindrome: 

To do this, I first took the input word given and turned it into a list. This was necessary so that I could use the "reverse" function to check if the word was in fact a palindrome, returning a boolean value depending on if it was.
I was unsure of how to make my own reverser function, I thought it would have something to do with the "car" and "cdr" functions but I was unable to figure out how to make my own implementation of reverse.

Fibonacci:

I've always had trouble with recursive methods, so this one was challenging for me. I first made a check for if the input given was less than 2, which would return the value itself. The rest goes through the function recursively adding the numbers until the end.

Two valid types:

This one was very straightforward, since it was just checking to add two numbers I simply had to use one line checking to see if the inputs were in fact both numbers. If they were, they would be added together and computed.
If not, I added another line confirming this and printing out that the inputs were invalding and that only two numbers could be used.
